# Tuition Buddy

Tuition Buddy is an open source tuition management system. It was inspired by personal work experiences where the need for software was vital. But there were budget constraints. So I started building the software I wish I had. I hope it will evolve and be useful to others.

Project Status: WIP. Launch date TBD.

View the application live on Heroku: TBD.
